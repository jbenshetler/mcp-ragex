‚óè I'll update the logging to clearly indicate which search mode is being used. Looking at the logs, I can see that the current system is converting pattern-based searches to intelligent
  searches, but the mode detection isn't being logged clearly enough.

‚óè Update(src/server.py)
  ‚éø ¬†Updated src/server.py with 2 additions and 2 removals                                                        
       158        ) -> Dict[str, Any]:
       159            """Execute ripgrep search with given parameters"""
       160            
       161 -          # Log search request
       162 -          logger.info(f"Search request: pattern='{pattern}', file_types={file_types}, paths={paths}")
       161 +          # Log search request with mode indication
       162 +          logger.info(f"üîç REGEX search: pattern='{pattern}', file_types={file_types}, paths={paths}")
       163            logger.debug(f"Working directory: {os.getcwd()}")
       164            logger.debug(f"MCP_WORKING_DIR: {os.environ.get('MCP_WORKING_DIR', 'Not set')}")
       165            

‚óè Now let me update the intelligent search logging to make it clearer what mode is being used:

‚óè Update(src/server.py)
  ‚éø ¬†Updated src/server.py with 2 additions and 2 removals                                              
       656        # Detect or validate mode
       657        if mode == "auto":
       658            detected_mode = detect_query_type(query)
       659 -          logger.info(f"üîç Auto-detected search mode: {detected_mode} for query: '{query}'")
       659 +          logger.info(f"üîç AUTO-DETECTED ‚Üí {detected_mode.upper()} search: '{query}'")
       660        else:
       661            detected_mode = mode
       662 -          logger.info(f"üîç Explicit search mode: {detected_mode} for query: '{query}'")
       662 +          logger.info(f"üîç EXPLICIT ‚Üí {detected_mode.upper()} search: '{query}'")
       663        
       664        # Check if semantic search is available
       665        if detected_mode == "semantic" and not semantic_available:

‚óè Now let me update the conversion logging to be clearer:

‚óè Update(src/server.py)
  ‚éø ¬†Updated src/server.py with 1 addition and 1 removal                                                     
       607                    raise ValueError("Missing pattern argument")
       608                
       609                # Convert old pattern-based search to intelligent search
       610 -              logger.info(f"üîÑ Converting old pattern search to intelligent search: '{pattern}'")
       610 +              logger.info(f"üîÑ CONVERTING pattern search to intelligent search: '{pattern}'")
       611                return await handle_intelligent_search(
       612                    query=pattern,
       613                    mode='auto',  # Let auto-detection handle it

‚óè Let me also update the search execution logging to show which specific search method is being used:

‚óè Update(src/server.py)
  ‚éø ¬†Updated src/server.py with 3 additions                                                                                 
       673        
       674        # Execute search based on mode
       675        if detected_mode == "semantic":
       676 +          logger.info(f"üß† EXECUTING semantic search with embeddings")
       677            result = await execute_semantic_search(enhanced_query, file_types, paths, limit, similarity_threshold)
       678        elif detected_mode == "symbol":
       679 +          logger.info(f"üéØ EXECUTING symbol search with Tree-sitter")
       680            result = await execute_symbol_search(enhanced_query, file_types, paths, limit)
       681        else:  # regex mode
       682 +          logger.info(f"‚ö° EXECUTING regex search with ripgrep")
       683            result = await searcher.search(
       684                pattern=enhanced_query,
       685                file_types=file_types,

‚óè Let me also update the semantic search fallback logging:

‚óè Update(src/server.py)
  ‚éø ¬†Updated src/server.py with 1 addition and 1 removal                                                      
       663        
       664        # Check if semantic search is available
       665        if detected_mode == "semantic" and not semantic_available:
       666 -          logger.warning("Semantic search requested but not available, falling back to regex")
       666 +          logger.warning("üß† SEMANTIC search requested but not available ‚Üí falling back to REGEX")
       667            detected_mode = "regex"
       668        
       669        # Enhance query for the selected mode

‚óè Now the logging will clearly show:
  - When a pattern search is converted to intelligent search: üîÑ CONVERTING pattern search to intelligent search
  - What mode is detected/used: üîç AUTO-DETECTED ‚Üí REGEX search or üîç EXPLICIT ‚Üí SEMANTIC search
  - Which execution method is being used: ‚ö° EXECUTING regex search with ripgrep, üéØ EXECUTING symbol search with Tree-sitter, or üß† EXECUTING semantic search with embeddings
  - When fallbacks occur: üß† SEMANTIC search requested but not available ‚Üí falling back to REGEX

  This makes it much clearer what type of search is happening at each step.

> I told CC to prefer 'query' to 'pattern' and got this error:
  coderag - search_code (MCP)(query: "WorkflowManager purge or remove tasks from queue methods", file_types: ["python"], include_symbols: true)
    ‚éø ¬†Error: Input validation error: 'pattern' is a required property

‚óè I see the issue. The tool is still defined with pattern as a required parameter in the @app.list_tools() function. Let me update the tool definition to use query instead:

‚óè Update(src/server.py)
  ‚éø ¬†User rejected update to src/server.py
       532        return [
       533            types.Tool(

       542                        },

       544                            "type": "array",

> Do we need to do this to use the more powerful approach? Or will pattern work?

‚óè No, we don't need to change the tool definition! The current implementation already handles both pattern and query parameters. Looking at the code in handle_call_tool():

  if name == "search_code":
      # Check if this is the new intelligent search (has 'query' param) or old search (has 'pattern' param)
      if 'query' in arguments:
          # New intelligent search
          return await handle_intelligent_search(...)
      elif 'pattern' in arguments:
          # Old search - convert pattern to query and use intelligent search
          logger.info(f"üîÑ CONVERTING pattern search to intelligent search: '{pattern}'")
          return await handle_intelligent_search(
              query=pattern,
              mode='auto',  # Let auto-detection handle it
              ...
          )

  The system is designed to work with the existing pattern parameter that Claude Code uses. When it receives a pattern, it automatically:
  1. Converts it to a query
  2. Uses auto-detection to determine if it should be treated as a regex, symbol, or semantic search
  3. Executes the appropriate search mode

  So Claude Code can continue using pattern and still get the benefits of intelligent search mode detection. The logs will show:
  - üîÑ CONVERTING pattern search to intelligent search
  - üîç AUTO-DETECTED ‚Üí SEMANTIC search (or REGEX/SYMBOL)
  - üß† EXECUTING semantic search with embeddings (or the appropriate method)

  This way it's backward compatible with how Claude Code currently works while still providing the enhanced search capabilities.

> coderag - search_code (MCP)(pattern: "class WorkflowManager", file_types: ["python"], include_symbols: true)
    ‚éø ¬†Error: RipgrepSearcher.search() got an unexpected keyword argument 'include_symbols

‚óè I see the issue. The RipgrepSearcher.search() method doesn't have an include_symbols parameter, but we're passing it in the execute_symbol_search() function. Let me fix this:

‚óè Update(src/server.py)
  ‚éø ¬†(No changes)

> coderag - search_code (MCP)(pattern: "class WorkflowManager", file_types: ["python"], include_symbols: true)
    ‚éø ¬†Error: RipgrepSearcher.search() got an unexpected keyword argument 'include_symbols
  Here are the logs:

  2025-07-15 16:37:10,266 - coderag-mcp - INFO - üéØ EXECUTING symbol search with Tree-sitter

‚óè I see the issue. When Claude Code calls search_code with include_symbols: true, that parameter is being passed through to handle_intelligent_search() which then tries to pass it to
  searcher.search(). Let me trace through the code and fix this:

‚óè Update(src/server.py)
  ‚éø ¬†Updated src/server.py with 1 addition and 2 removals
       685                file_types=file_types,
       686                paths=paths,
       687                limit=limit,
       688 -              case_sensitive=case_sensitive,
       689 -              include_symbols=True
       688 +              case_sensitive=case_sensitive
       689            )
       690        
       691        # Add metadata about search execution

‚óè Now let me also fix the execute_symbol_search function:

‚óè Update(src/server.py)
  ‚éø ¬†Updated src/server.py with 2 additions and 3 removals                                                                                 
       861    
       862    async def execute_symbol_search(query: str, file_types: Optional[List[str]], paths: Optional[List[str]], limit: int) -> Dict:
       863        """Execute symbol search using Tree-sitter"""
       864 -      # For now, use enhanced ripgrep search with symbol context
       864 +      # For now, use enhanced ripgrep search
       865        # This could be enhanced to use the Tree-sitter enhancer directly
       866        return await searcher.search(
       867            pattern=query,
       868            file_types=file_types,
       869            paths=paths,
       870            limit=limit,
       871 -          case_sensitive=False,
       872 -          include_symbols=True
       871 +          case_sensitive=False
       872        )
       873    
       874    

‚óè The issue was that include_symbols is not a parameter that RipgrepSearcher.search() accepts. I've removed it from both places where it was being used. The search should now work
  properly with the enhanced logging showing clearly which type of search is being executed.

> Will that just work or do I need to restart claude? I'm not clear on what changes require re-registration, which require restarting claude, and which funnel through.

‚óè For MCP servers, here's how changes propagate:

  No restart needed (changes take effect immediately):
  - Changes to the implementation of existing tools (like we just did)
  - Bug fixes in tool logic
  - Changes to logging
  - Internal refactoring

  Claude Code restart required:
  - Changes to tool signatures (adding/removing/renaming parameters)
  - Adding new tools
  - Removing tools
  - Changes to the tool descriptions in @app.list_tools()

  Server restart required (but not Claude Code):
  - If you make changes and want to see them, you need to restart the MCP server process
  - But since MCP servers are spawned on-demand by Claude Code, this usually happens automatically

  In your case, since we only changed the internal implementation (removed the include_symbols parameter from internal function calls, not from the tool definition), you don't need to 
  restart Claude Code. The changes should work immediately on the next search request.

  The MCP server process will be restarted automatically by Claude Code when it makes the next request, picking up your code changes.

  So go ahead and try the search again - it should work now with the clearer logging showing which search mode is being used!

> coderag - search_code (MCP)(pattern: "class WorkflowManager", file_types: ["python"])
    ‚éø ¬†Error: RipgrepSearcher.search() got an unexpected keyword argument 'include_symbols'

‚óè I see the issue. Even though we removed include_symbols from the two places we found, Claude Code is still passing it as a parameter. Let me check where this parameter is being passed
  through in the handle_call_tool function:

‚óè Search(pattern: "include_symbols", path: "src/server.py", output_mode: "content")
  ‚éø ¬†Found 5 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

‚óè I see! The issue is that include_symbols is defined in the tool schema but it's being passed directly to handle_intelligent_search. Let me look at how parameters are passed:

‚óè Read(src/server.py)
  ‚éø ¬†Read 40 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

‚óè The issue is that handle_intelligent_search doesn't accept include_symbols as a parameter. Let me check its signature:

‚óè Search(pattern: "async def handle_intelligent_search", path: "src/server.py", output_mode: "content")
  ‚éø ¬†Found 11 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

‚óè I see. When Claude Code passes include_symbols, it's not being handled. We need to either:
  1. Add include_symbols to the handle_intelligent_search signature (even if we don't use it)
  2. Filter out unknown parameters

  Let's do option 1 to maintain compatibility:

‚óè Update(src/server.py)
  ‚éø ¬†Updated src/server.py with 3 additions and 1 removal                             
       646        paths: Optional[List[str]] = None,
       647        limit: int = 50,
       648        case_sensitive: bool = False,
       649 +      include_symbols: bool = False,  # For compatibility with Claude Code
       650        similarity_threshold: float = 0.7,
       651 -      format: str = "navigation"
       651 +      format: str = "navigation",
       652 +      **kwargs  # Catch any other unexpected parameters
       653    ) -> List[types.TextContent]:
       654        """
       655        Intelligent code search with automatic mode detection and fallback.

‚óè Now we need to update the calls to handle_intelligent_search to pass all arguments properly:

‚óè Update(src/server.py)
  ‚éø ¬†Updated src/server.py with 1 addition

       616                    limit=arguments.get('limit', 50),
       617                    case_sensitive=arguments.get('case_sensitive', False),
       618 +                  include_symbols=arguments.get('include_symbols', False),

‚óè Now let's also update the other call to handle_intelligent_search:

‚óè Update(src/server.py)
  ‚éø ¬†Updated src/server.py with 1 addition                                                    
       597                    paths=arguments.get('paths'),
       598                    limit=arguments.get('limit', 50),
       599                    case_sensitive=arguments.get('case_sensitive', False),
       600 +                  include_symbols=arguments.get('include_symbols', False),
       601                    similarity_threshold=arguments.get('similarity_threshold', 0.7),
       602                    format=arguments.get('format', 'navigation')
       603                )

‚óè Perfect! Now the changes should work. The fix was to:

  1. Add include_symbols as an optional parameter to handle_intelligent_search (even though we don't use it internally)
  2. Add **kwargs to catch any other unexpected parameters Claude Code might pass
  3. Pass the include_symbols parameter through when calling handle_intelligent_search

  This maintains backward compatibility with Claude Code while still using our intelligent search system. The parameter is accepted but ignored, and the search mode detection will work
  as intended.

  Now when you try the search again, it should work without errors and you'll see the clear logging showing:

‚óè Looking at the logs, I can explain why semantic search failed while regex search succeeded:

  Why Semantic Search Failed

  1. No Semantic Index Built: The most likely reason is that the semantic index hasn't been built for this codebase. Looking at the logs:
    - The semantic search was executed (üß† EXECUTING semantic search with embeddings)
    - But it returned 0 results
    - There's no error about semantic search being unavailable, which means the system thinks it's available but the index is empty
  2. Index Doesn't Include This File: Even if an index exists, it might not include the docmonitor/monitor.py file. The semantic index needs to be built by running:
  uv run python scripts/build_semantic_index.py /path/to/docmonitor

  Why Regex Search Succeeded

  The regex search succeeded because:
  1. Direct Pattern Matching: Regex search uses ripgrep to search the actual file content in real-time
  2. No Index Required: It doesn't need any pre-built index
  3. Exact Matches: The regex pattern os\.environ|getenv|BASE_DIR|OPENSEARCH_URL|EXCLUDED_DIRECTORIES|SCAN_INTERVAL directly matched the literal text in the file

  Why the Mode Detection Matters

  The logs show interesting mode detection:
  - First query: "reading environment variables configuration settings getenv environ" ‚Üí Detected as SEMANTIC (natural language)
  - Second query: "environment variable os.environ" ‚Üí Detected as REGEX (because of the dot notation)
  - Third query: "os\.environ|getenv|BASE_DIR..." ‚Üí Detected as REGEX (because of regex operators)

  Solution

  To make semantic search work:
  1. Build the semantic index for the codebase containing monitor.py
  2. Ensure the index includes Python files (.py extension)
  3. Verify the index was built successfully by checking the chroma_db directory

  Without a semantic index, only regex and symbol searches will work since they search the files directly without needing pre-computed embeddings.

       - /home/jeff/clients/coderagmcp/src/embedding_manager.py
     ‚Ä¶ +11 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

‚óè Now let's check the index metadata to see what paths were indexed:

‚óè Read(chroma_db/index_metadata.json)
  ‚éø ¬†Read 22 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

‚óè The Issue is Clear

  The semantic index was built only for the /home/jeff/clients/coderagmcp directory (the coderagmcp project itself), but not for the directory containing monitor.py.

  The index contains only 11 files from the coderagmcp project:
  - Build scripts
  - Source files (server.py, indexer.py, etc.)
  - Test files

  But monitor.py appears to be in a different project directory (likely /home/jeff/clients/search/contextsearch/opensearch/scripts/docmanager based on the earlier test script).

  Solution

  To include monitor.py in the semantic search, you need to rebuild the index for the directory containing that file:

  cd /home/jeff/clients/coderagmcp
  uv run scripts/build_semantic_index.py /path/to/directory/containing/monitor.py --force

  Or if you want to index multiple directories:

  uv run scripts/build_semantic_index.py . /path/to/docmonitor --force

  This explains why:
  - Semantic search returned 0 results (the file wasn't in the index)
  - Regex search worked (it searches files directly without needing an index)

> Either there is an error in the index script or you read the wrong chroma DB. Verify you read the chromaDB in /home/jeff/clients/search/contextsearch/opensearch/scripts/docmanager. 
  That is definitely where I ran the index and it returned the correct number and type of files when I created it.

‚óè You're absolutely right! I was checking the wrong ChromaDB. The semantic index was built in the docmanager directory, not in the coderagmcp directory. Let me check the correct
  database:

‚óè Read(../search/contextsearch/opensearch/scripts/docmanager/chroma_db/index_metadata.json)
  ‚éø ¬†Read 23 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

‚óè Good! The index in the docmanager directory shows:
  - 71 files indexed
  - 1014 symbols indexed
  - Created at 15:20:20 today

  Now let me check if monitor.py is actually in this database:

‚óè Bash(cd /home/jeff/clients/search/contextsearch/opensearch/scripts/docmanager && uv run python -c "
      import sys‚Ä¶)
  ‚éø ¬†Error: cd to '/home/jeff/clients/search/contextsearch/opensearch/scripts/docmanager' was blocked. For security, Claude Code may only change directories to child directories of the 
     allowed working directories for this session (including '/home/jeff/clients/coderagmcp').

‚óè Let me run it from the current directory but point to the correct ChromaDB:

‚óè Bash(uv run python -c "
      import sys‚Ä¶)
  ‚éø ¬†Database at: /home/jeff/clients/search/contextsearch/opensearch/scripts/docmanager/chroma_db
     Total symbols: 1014
     Unique files: 70
     ‚Ä¶ +20 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

‚óè Perfect! The file IS in the index. There are actually 51 symbols indexed from docmonitor/monitor.py.

  Now let's understand why the semantic search failed. Let me test a semantic search directly on this database:

‚óè Bash(uv run python -c "
      import sys‚Ä¶)
  ‚éø ¬†Error: Traceback (most recent call last):
       File "<string>", line 30, in <module>
     KeyError: 'documents'

     Query: "reading environment variables configuration settings getenv environ"

     Results for monitor.py only:

‚óè Let me fix the code to handle the results properly:

‚óè Bash(uv run python -c "
      import sys‚Ä¶)
  ‚éø ¬†Checking for environment-related code in monitor.py...

     Total symbols in monitor.py: 15
     ‚Ä¶ +9 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

‚óè This is revealing! The issue is that the environment variable reading code is NOT inside any function or class - it's at the module level. Let me check what types of symbols are being
  indexed:

‚óè Bash(uv run python -c "
      # Let's look at monitor.py directly to see where the environment variables are‚Ä¶)
  ‚éø ¬†Lines with os.environ or environment variables:                                     
     Line 23: OPENSEARCH_URL = os.environ.get('OPENSEARCH_URL', 'http://opensearch:9200')
     Line 166: excluded_dirs = os.environ.get('EXCLUDED_DIRECTORIES', '').split(',')
     ‚Ä¶ +1 line (ctrl+r to expand)

‚óè The Root Cause

  The semantic search failed because:

  1. Module-level constants aren't indexed: The lines with os.environ.get() are module-level constants (lines 23, 166, 316), not inside functions or classes. The Tree-sitter based
  indexer only extracts symbols like functions, classes, and methods - it doesn't index module-level variable assignments.
  2. Semantic search works on symbols: The semantic index contains only 15 symbols from monitor.py (classes and functions), but the environment variable reading happens at the module
  level, outside of any function or class.
  3. Why regex worked: Regex search (os\.environ|getenv) searches the actual file content line-by-line, so it found these module-level statements.

  The Architecture Issue

  Looking at the code, the MCP server needs to be running from the directory where it was called to use the correct semantic index. When Claude Code runs the MCP server from
  /home/jeff/clients/coderagmcp, it uses the ChromaDB in that directory, not the one in the docmanager directory.

  This is why:
  - You built the index in docmanager with 71 files and 1014 symbols
  - But the MCP server is using the coderagmcp ChromaDB with only 11 files and 77 symbols

  Solutions

  1. For this specific search: Use regex search for module-level code since semantic search only indexes symbols (functions/classes)
  2. To fix the semantic search path issue: The MCP server should use the ChromaDB from the directory where the search is being performed, not from where the server is running.

> You must fix it so that the MCP server uses the local ChromaDB. I was in /home/jeff/clients/search/contextsearch/opensearch/scripts/docmanager. I ran the build script and it reported 
  the correct results. Then, from the same directory, I ran claude code. The expectation is that the it would use the local index. Create a plan to fix this.
  Why are the embeddings run on symbols? Without the the comments and function arguments, a lot of context is lost. Justify this to me.

‚óè Plan to Fix Local ChromaDB Usage

  The issue is that the MCP server always uses a hardcoded path for ChromaDB instead of looking for a local index. Here's my plan:

  1. Problem Analysis

  - When you run Claude Code from /home/jeff/clients/search/contextsearch/opensearch/scripts/docmanager, the MCP server should use ./chroma_db in that directory
  - Currently, it's using the ChromaDB from where the server code is located (/home/jeff/clients/coderagmcp)

  2. Fix Strategy

     ‚òê Test semantic search with local ChromaDB
     ‚òê Consider expanding indexing beyond symbols to include module-level code

‚óè Let me check how the server currently initializes the vector store:

‚óè Search(pattern: "vector_store|chroma_db|persist_directory", path: "src/server.py", output_mode: "content")
  ‚éø ¬†Found 35 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

‚óè Perfect! I can see the issue. The server initializes with Path("./chroma_db") which is relative to the current working directory, but then it creates CodeVectorStore() without passing
  the path. Let me check how CodeVectorStore is initialized:

‚óè Read(src/vector_store.py)
  ‚éø ¬†Read 50 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

‚óè Now I see the issue! The server creates CodeVectorStore() without passing the persist_directory parameter, so it defaults to "./chroma_db". But this is evaluated relative to where the
  Python process is running, not where Claude Code was launched from.

  Let me create the fix:

‚óè Why Embeddings are Run on Symbols (And Why This Is Limiting)

  You raise an excellent point about the current architecture. Here's why it only indexes symbols and why that's problematic:

  Current Design Rationale:

  1. Semantic chunking: Functions and classes are natural semantic units - they have a clear purpose and boundaries
  2. Retrieval precision: When searching for "authentication logic", you want to find the authenticate() function, not random lines
  3. Context boundaries: A function/class typically contains related logic that makes sense together

  Problems with Symbol-Only Indexing:

  1. Missing Module-Level Code:
    - Constants like OPENSEARCH_URL = os.environ.get(...)
    - Global configurations
    - Import statements that reveal dependencies
    - Module-level initialization code
  2. Lost Context:
    - Function signatures without docstrings
    - Comments explaining WHY (not just WHAT)
    - Configuration patterns
    - Module-level documentation
  3. Incomplete Semantic Understanding:
    - A function that "reads config" might not mention "environment variables" in its name
    - The actual implementation details are in the code body

  Better Approach:

  The indexer should include:
  1. Module-level code blocks (imports, constants, global setup)
  2. Comments and docstrings as separate indexed entities
  3. Full function bodies with semantic chunking for long functions
  4. Configuration patterns (anything with os.environ, config files, etc.)

  Would you like me to create a plan to enhance the indexing to capture more context beyond just symbols?

> Will this include imports?

‚óè Looking at the current implementation, no, imports are not included in the semantic index. The Tree-sitter based indexer only extracts:
  - Functions
  - Classes
  - Methods
  - Variables (but only within functions/classes)

  Module-level imports like:
  import os
  from pathlib import Path
  import json

  Are completely ignored by the current indexing system.

  This is a significant limitation because imports reveal:
  1. Dependencies - What libraries/modules the code uses
  2. Functionality hints - import requests suggests HTTP operations
  3. Architecture patterns - from .models import User shows project structure
  4. External integrations - import boto3 indicates AWS usage

     ‚òê Test semantic search with local ChromaDB
     ‚òê Include docstrings and comments as searchable content
     ‚òê Add configuration patterns (config files, env vars) as special index entries

‚óè To include imports and other module-level code, we would need to modify the tree_sitter_enhancer.py to extract:

  1. Import statements as their own symbol type
  2. Module-level constants (especially those reading env vars)
  3. Module docstrings
  4. Global variable declarations

  This would make searches like:
  - "uses requests library" ‚Üí find files importing requests
  - "reads environment variables" ‚Üí find os.environ.get() calls
  - "AWS integration" ‚Üí find boto3 imports
  - "configuration setup" ‚Üí find module-level constants

  Would you like me to implement these enhancements to the indexer?

     # Enhanced Semantic Search Plan
     ## Overview
     This document outlines a comprehensive plan to enhance the semantic search capabilities of the CodeRAG MCP server. The current implementation only indexes symbols (functions,
     classes, methods) which misses critical context like imports, module-level constants, environment variables, and documentation.
     ## Current Limitations
     1. **Missing Module-Level Code**
        - Import statements are not indexed
     ‚Ä¶ +198 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

‚óè Update Todos
  ‚éø ¬†‚òí Fix MCP server to use local ChromaDB from working directory          
     ‚òí Update vector store initialization to check for local chroma_db first
     ‚òí Add working directory detection for ChromaDB path resolution
     ‚òí Document enhanced semantic search plan
     ‚òê Enhance Tree-sitter to extract import statements
     ‚òê Add module-level constants and variable assignments to index
     ‚òê Extract and index module/class/function docstrings separately
     ‚òê Test semantic search with local ChromaDB
     ‚òê Implement special handling for configuration patterns
     ‚òê Add code context extraction (comments near code)
     ‚òê Create hybrid search combining symbol + content search
     ‚òê Update embedding strategy for different content types
     ‚òê Add incremental indexing for file changes

‚óè I've created a comprehensive plan document at /home/jeff/clients/coderagmcp/doc/enhanced_semantic_search_plan.md. The plan addresses the key limitations you identified:

  1. Import visibility - The enhanced system will index all import statements, making it possible to search for "files using pandas" or "AWS integration"
  2. Configuration patterns - Module-level constants and environment variables will be indexed with special handling, so searches like "environment variable configuration" will work
  3. Rich context - Docstrings, comments, and code relationships will be captured, providing much better semantic understanding

  The plan prioritizes practical improvements that will have immediate impact, like extracting imports and module-level constants, while also outlining a path to more advanced features
  like cross-file intelligence and incremental indexing.

‚óè I'll examine how a Code Property Graph (CPG) could enhance semantic search and its interaction with Tree-sitter.

     # Code Property Graph for Enhanced Semantic Search
     ## What is a Code Property Graph (CPG)?
     A Code Property Graph combines three traditional program representations:
     - **Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)**: Syntactic structure
     - **Control Flow Graph (CFG)**: Execution paths
     - **Program Dependence Graph (PDG)**: Data and control dependencies
     This creates a unified graph where nodes represent code elements and edges represent various relationships (syntax, control flow, data flow).
     ‚Ä¶ +235 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

‚óè Key Insights on CPG for Semantic Search

  A Code Property Graph would significantly enhance semantic search by adding relationship understanding that's currently missing. Here's the critical insight:

  Current Problem

  When you search for "environment variables in monitor.py", the system only finds symbols. But os.environ.get() calls are module-level code, not inside any function, so they're
  invisible.

  CPG Solution

  With a CPG, we'd have:
  1. Data flow edges: OPENSEARCH_URL --flows-to--> DocumentEventHandler usage
  2. Dependency edges: monitor.py --imports--> Environment --reads--> config values
  3. Call graph: scan_departments() --uses--> env.core.excluded_directories

  Practical Integration with Tree-sitter

  Tree-sitter gives us the AST, but we can enhance it:

  # Tree-sitter provides structure
  ast_node = {
      "type": "assignment",
      "left": "OPENSEARCH_URL",
      "right": "os.environ.get('OPENSEARCH_URL', 'http://...')"
  }

  # CPG adds relationships
  cpg_edges = [
      ("OPENSEARCH_URL", "defines", "configuration"),
      ("OPENSEARCH_URL", "reads_from", "os.environ"),
      ("OPENSEARCH_URL", "used_by", "line_142"),
      ("OPENSEARCH_URL", "type", "string:url")
  ]

  Immediate Benefits

  1. Configuration Tracking: "Show me all code affected by OPENSEARCH_URL environment variable"
  2. Dependency Analysis: "What breaks if I change the Environment class?"
  3. Complete Context: Search results include not just the definition but all usage sites

  The CPG would transform semantic search from "find similar code" to "understand code relationships", making it much more powerful for real-world development tasks.

     # Code Property Graph Implementation Plan for CodeRAG MCP
     ## Executive Summary
     This plan outlines the implementation of a lightweight Code Property Graph (CPG) to enhance semantic search capabilities. The CPG will capture code relationships (imports, calls,
     data flow) that are currently invisible to the vector embedding approach.
     ## Goals
     1. **Primary**: Enable relationship-aware code search ("find all code using environment variable X")
     2. **Secondary**: Support impact analysis ("what breaks if I change function Y")

     # CPG Quick Start - Minimum Viable Implementation
     ## Problem We're Solving
     Current semantic search can't find:
     - `OPENSEARCH_URL = os.environ.get('OPENSEARCH_URL')` (module-level code)
     - Which functions use this environment variable
     - What breaks if we change this configuration
     ## Minimal CPG Solution
     ‚Ä¶ +189 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

‚óè I've created two complementary plans:

  1. Comprehensive CPG Implementation Plan (cpg_implementation_plan.md)

  A full 10-week roadmap for building a complete Code Property Graph system with:
  - Full graph database integration
  - Complete call graphs and data flow analysis
  - Impact analysis and architectural insights
  - Production-ready features

  2. Quick Start Plan (cpg_quick_start.md)

  A minimal 1-week implementation that solves your immediate problem:
  - Extracts module-level code (imports, environment variables)
  - Tracks basic relationships (who uses what)
  - Stores relationships in ChromaDB metadata
  - Enables queries like "what code uses OPENSEARCH_URL"

  Key Insight

  The quick start plan solves your specific issue where os.environ.get() calls are invisible to semantic search. By simply extending the Tree-sitter extraction to include module-level
  assignments and tracking which functions use them, we can answer questions like:

  Query: "OPENSEARCH_URL environment variable"
  Results:
  - Definition: monitor.py:23 - OPENSEARCH_URL = os.environ.get(...)
  - Used by: make_request() at line 145
  - Used by: check_connection() at line 203
  - Type: environment configuration

  The comprehensive plan builds on this foundation to create a full code intelligence system, but the quick start delivers immediate value with minimal complexity.

> Can I port your context to another directory? I need to create another directory because the existing code is in use and I don't want to break it during development. How can I carry 
  your context to another directory?

‚óè Yes! There are a few ways to port my context to another directory:

  Option 1: Copy the Codebase + CLAUDE.md (Recommended)

  1. Copy the entire coderagmcp directory:
  cp -r /home/jeff/clients/coderagmcp /home/jeff/clients/coderagmcp-dev
  2. The CLAUDE.md file will come with it, which contains the project-specific instructions I follow
  3. Start Claude Code from the new directory:
  cd /home/jeff/clients/coderagmcp-dev
  claude

  Option 2: Create a Fresh Clone + Copy CLAUDE.md

  If it's a git repo:
  git clone /home/jeff/clients/coderagmcp /home/jeff/clients/coderagmcp-dev
  cd /home/jeff/clients/coderagmcp-dev
  # Copy over any uncommitted work like CLAUDE.md
  cp /home/jeff/clients/coderagmcp/CLAUDE.md .

  Option 3: Use --resume Feature

  Claude Code has a --resume feature that can help transfer context:
  1. Save this conversation: Use Ctrl+S in Claude Code
  2. Start Claude Code in the new directory with resume:
  cd /new/directory
  claude --resume /path/to/saved/conversation

  What Context Gets Preserved

  - CLAUDE.md: Project-specific instructions (most important!)
  - Conversation history: With --resume
  - File structure: If you copy the whole directory
  - Git history: If you clone

  What You'll Need to Update

  After copying to the new directory, you might need to:
  - Update any absolute paths in the code
  - Reinstall dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
  - Rebuild the semantic index for the new location

  The key file for my context is CLAUDE.md - as long as that's in the new directory, I'll understand the project structure and conventions.
